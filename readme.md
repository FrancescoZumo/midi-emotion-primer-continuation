# symbolic music generation conditioned on valence, arousal and midi primer

Code written for my master's thesis: Procedural music generation forvideogames conditioned through video emotion recognition

This folder contains the code written 

This code is based on the pre-trained Music transformer proposed by Sulun et al. : https://github.com/serkansulun/midi-emotion
in order to run main.py you first need to download the code from that repository, in particular you need to add `src/data`, `src/models`, `src/create_datasets` to the project folder.
